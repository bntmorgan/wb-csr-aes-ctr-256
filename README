This project brings a aes256 cryptocore in counter mode compatible with
Milkymist FPGA SoC. The code uses explicitly Xilinx virtex 6 RAM blocks, but it
can be easily modified to a RAM core, containing RAM block inferrable code.

The user interface is quite simple. You can configure the core parameters with
the CSR bus (AES key, IV, command and status registers). The wishbone part of
the core exposes two RAM regions containing the clear or the encryted data.
On shall use the same hardware interface to encryt or decryt (symmetric cipher).

Have fun
